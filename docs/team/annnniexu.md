## Overview
Omnitravel is a Command-Line Interface application that is designed to assist travel planning and organization.
Users can add general activities, accommodations, food, landmarks to their travel activity list. 
Users can also associate tags and expenses with travel activities as well as look activities up by date, keywords, and tag.
