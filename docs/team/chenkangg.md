#### New features:

* Added the ability to get help 
  * What it does: allows the user to view a list of available commands for the app
  * Justification: This feature is important as a new user may not be familiar with how to use the Omnitravel app, thus 
    providing an easy way to assist a user to view all the commands.


* Added the ability to add and remove tags 
  * What it does: allows the user to tag an existing travel activity and remove a tag from an existing travel activity
    if needed. 
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can tag a travel activity which can 
    help to better organise their travel activities and conveniently remove the tag to rectify if required.


* Added the ability to add and remove expenses
 
  * What it does: allows the user to add an expense to an existing travel activity and remove an expense from an 
    existing travel activity if needed.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can add an expense to a travel activity 
    which can help to track their finances and conveniently remove the expense to rectify if required.


* Added the ability to list tags
  * What it does: allows the user to list out all the tags that have been added.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user may have forgotten what tags they have 
    given to different travel activities. This feature allows users to view all tags quickly and easily.
